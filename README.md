## Requirements
These files use data sets that are uploaded to Zenodo, at the [URL](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3760027)

The code assumes that the data is located at ./data

A python 3.x installation is required, as well as the packages inside
`requirements.txt` and the `fast_features` package. Instructions for `fast_features` package are inside the fast_features directory.

```
pip3 install --user -r requirements.txt
```

The jupyter notebooks as well as `faithfulness.py` and `robustness.py` are entry points for different
experiments in the paper, and the remaining files are shared code for data
loading, explainability methods, or machine learning methods.
